      <h3>Open Access</h3>
      <p class="body">Currently, all of the journals published by Avestia are based on the Open Access (OA) model. Unlike traditional publishing, this model allows for the published material to be accessible by everyone without any subscription fees; instead, publication costs are covered by the authors. Furthermore, unlike most traditional models where copyright is transferred to the publisher, authors retain copyrights. At the same time, due to wide access to articles in the OA model, citation counts can grow quickly for high quality articles. As a result, published material can have quicker and wider impact. It is important to note that similar to subscription-based publications, all articles are subjected to peer-review in the open access model, and the model does not impact the publication process.</p>
