      <h3>Become a Reviewer or an Editor</h3>
      <p class="body">Reviewers and Editors are vital to the success of peer-reviewed academic journals, and we at Avestia are truly grateful for all the time and hard work of our dedicated Reviewers and Editors.</p>

      <p class="body">In very broad terms, Reviewers are responsible for providing the editors with professional, technical, and unbiased feedback regarding an article in question, while editors are responsible for assigning related reviewers to submitted articles, gathering their feedbacks, and making decisions regarding the articles accordingly. Furthermore, Editors are often involved in development of editorial policies. Detailed instructions and support regarding the roles and associated activities are provided upon logging in as a Reviewer or an Editor at our <a href="http://amss.avestia.com" class="body-link">online manuscript submission system (AMSS)</a>.</p>

      <p class="body">If you are interested in becoming a Reviewer or an Editor for one of the Journals published by Avestia, please send your complete academic CV, the name of the Journal of interest, and whether you would like to serve as a Reviewer or an Editor to <a href="mailto:journals@avestia.com" class="body-link">journals@avestia.com</a>. Please note that to qualify as a reviewer, you will need to be an experienced researcher in your field with a PhD degree and in most cases a university faculty member. To qualify as an Editor, you will need to be a university faculty member, with an extensive publication record. Additionally, Editors and especially Editor-in-Chief positions are only assigned upon the positions being vacant.</p>
