      <h2>Ethics in Publishing</h2>
      <p class="body">At Avestia, we take matters that relate to ethics in publishing very seriously. We believe that the peer-review publication process is a vital building block of academia, and its integrity must be maintained at all costs. To achieve this goal, we believe authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers alike must play their roles with high standard and care.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Authors</b> must refrain from plagiarism, data/result fabrication, fundamental and critical errors, multiple redundant/concurrent publications, unethical experiments with animal or human subjects. They must also report and disclose honestly and fully all related standards, references and sources, conflicts of interest, and maintain originality in their work. It is also highly encouraged that authors enable access to data, code, methods, and other resources required to replicate or enhance the performed studies.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Reviewers</b> are highly encouraged to accept reviews of manuscripts that are well within the reviewerâ€™s areas of expertise and do not pose any conflict of interest towards the author(s) or the article. All assigned manuscripts are to remain confidential. The reviewers should try to keep deadlines and be as prompt as possible.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Editors</b> must keep all manuscripts confidential and handle manuscripts promptly. They must facilitate a fair, accurate, and rigorous peer-review process, and make the final decision on the article.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Conflict of Interest</b> is another serious matter that authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers must tend to. This situation arises when one or more parties fail to perform their duties impartially due to non-technical reasons. Authors are to disclose any non-scientific motivating/competing factors in their research, and are encouraged to inform the Editor in Chief or publisher should they believe that their manuscript is at risk of being subject to Conflict of Interest by particular reviewers or editors. Reviewers and editors need to inform the Editor in Chief or the publisher, should they believe that they are biased towards a particular manuscript based on unscientific grounds such as financial or personal factors. In any case that a potential or existing Conflict of Interest is reported, Avestia ensures that required steps will be taken to allow for a fair handling and treatment of the manuscript by arranging for it to be handled by impartial individuals.</p>

      <p class="body">Finally, Avestia is committed to creating a diverse, fair, and scientifically accurate platform for academic peer-review-based publishing. We are obliged to maintain high standards and not allow for commercial revenue to impact the quality of the publishing process. We must be responsive to our readers, and when needed, communicate with all the editors, reviewers, and authors of the journals that we publish.</p>
